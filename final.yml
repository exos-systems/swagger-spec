                        Resources are physical or non-physical components (or
                        some combination of these) within an enterprise's
                        infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed
                        or used by services (for example a physical port
                        assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization
                        of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be
                        drawn from the Application, Computing and Network
                        domains, and include, for example, Network Elements,
                        software, IT systems, content and information, and
                        technology components.

                        A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                        representing a generic means for implementing a
                        particular type of Resource. In essence, a
                        ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and
                        relationships of a set of related Resources, while
                        Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a
                        particular ResourceSpecification.

        Is based on both the basic cost to develop and produce products and the
        enterprises policy on revenue targets. This price may be further revised
        through discounting (a Product Offering Price that reflects an
        alteration). The price, applied for a productOffering may also be
        influenced by the productOfferingTerm, the customer selected, eg: a
        productOffering can be offered with multiple terms, like commitment
        periods for the contract. The price may be influenced by this
        productOfferingTerm. A productOffering may be cheaper with a 24 month
        commitment than with a 12 month commitment.

              A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing
              a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In
              essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and
              relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource
              defines a specific instance that is based on a particular
              ResourceSpecification.

              Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
              combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or
              inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for
              example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to
              the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can
              be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and
              include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems,
              content and information, and technology components.

              A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing
              a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In
              essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and
              relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource
              defines a specific instance that is based on a particular
              ResourceSpecification.

              Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
              combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or
              inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for
              example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to
              the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can
              be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and
              include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems,
              content and information, and technology components.

              A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing
              a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In
              essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and
              relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource
              defines a specific instance that is based on a particular
              ResourceSpecification.

        Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination
        of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. They are
        typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port
        assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product
        (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the Application,
        Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network
        Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology
        components.

        A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a
        generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In
        essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and
        relationships of a set of related Resources, while Resource defines a
        specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification.

                apply or override the properties of similar properties contained
                in ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValue. It should be noted
                that characteristics which their value(s) addressed by this
                object must exist in corresponding product specification. The
                available characteristic values for a
                ProductSpecificationCharacteristic in a Product specification
                can be modified at the ProductOffering level. For example, a
                characteristic 'Color' might have values White, Blue, Green, and
                Red. But, the list of values can be restricted to e.g. White and
                Blue in an associated product offering. It should be noted that
                the list of values in
                'ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValueUse' is a strict subset
                of the list of values as defined in the corresponding product

                  A use of the ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValue by a
                  ProductOffering to which additional properties (attributes)
                  apply or override the properties of similar properties
                  contained in ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValue. It
                  should be noted that characteristics which their value(s)
                  addressed by this object must exist in corresponding product
                  specification. The available characteristic values for a
                  ProductSpecificationCharacteristic in a Product specification
                  can be modified at the ProductOffering level. For example, a
                  characteristic 'Color' might have values White, Blue, Green,
                  and Red. But, the list of values can be restricted to e.g.
                  White and Blue in an associated product offering. It should be
                  noted that the list of values in
                  'ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValueUse' is a strict
                  subset of the list of values as defined in the corresponding
                  product specification characteristics.

                    ProductOffering to which additional properties (attributes)
                    apply or override the properties of similar properties
                    contained in ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValue. It
                    should be noted that characteristics which their value(s)
                    addressed by this object must exist in corresponding product
                    specification. The available characteristic values for a
                    ProductSpecificationCharacteristic in a Product
                    specification can be modified at the ProductOffering level.
                    For example, a characteristic 'Color' might have values
                    White, Blue, Green, and Red. But, the list of values can be
                    restricted to e.g. White and Blue in an associated product
                    offering. It should be noted that the list of values in

                    subset of the list of values as defined in the corresponding

                      A use of the ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValue by a
                      ProductOffering to which additional properties
                      (attributes) apply or override the properties of similar
                      properties contained in
                      ProductSpecificationCharacteristicValue. It should be
                      noted that characteristics which their value(s) addressed
                      by this object must exist in corresponding product
                      specification. The available characteristic values for a
                      ProductSpecificationCharacteristic in a Product
                      specification can be modified at the ProductOffering
                      level. For example, a characteristic 'Color' might have
                      values White, Blue, Green, and Red. But, the list of
                      values can be restricted to e.g. White and Blue in an
                      associated product offering. It should be noted that the

                      subset of the list of values as defined in the
                      corresponding product specification characteristics.

                  ProductSpecificationCharacteristic in a Product specification
                  can be modified at the ProductOffering level. For example, a

                  White and Blue in an associated product offering. It should be

                      by this object must exist in corresponding product
                      specification. The available characteristic values for a

                  ProductSpecificationCharacteristic in a Product specification
                  can be modified at the ProductOffering level. For example, a
                  characteristic 'Color' might have values White, Blue, Green,

                  White and Blue in an associated product offering. It should be

                  subset of the list of values as defined in the corresponding

                      Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                      combination of these) within an enterprise's
                      infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed
                      or used by services (for example a physical port assigned
                      to a service) or contribute to the realization of a
                      Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from
                      the Application, Computing and Network domains, and
                      include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT
                      systems, content and information, and technology
                      components.

                      A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                      representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                      type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification
                      defines the common attributes and relationships of a set
                      of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific
                      instance that is based on a particular
                      ResourceSpecification.

                  Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                  combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or
                  inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services
                  (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or
                  contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM
                  card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and
                  Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements,
                  software, IT systems, content and information, and technology
                  components.

                  A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                  representing a generic means for implementing a particular

                    discrete value, such as color, can take on a range of
                    values, (for example, sensitivity of 100-240 mV), or can be
                    derived from a formula (for example, usage time (hrs) = 30 -
                    talk time *3). Certain characteristics, such as color, may
                    be configured during the ordering or some other process.

                      Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                      combination of these) within an enterprise's
                      infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed
                      or used by services (for example a physical port assigned
                      to a service) or contribute to the realization of a
                      Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from
                      the Application, Computing and Network domains, and
                      include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT
                      systems, content and information, and technology
                      components.

                      A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                      representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                      type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification
                      defines the common attributes and relationships of a set
                      of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific
                      instance that is based on a particular
                      ResourceSpecification.

                  Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                  combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or
                  inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services
                  (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or
                  contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM
                  card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and
                  Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements,
                  software, IT systems, content and information, and technology
                  components.

                  A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                  representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                  type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines
                  the common attributes and relationships of a set of related
                  Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is
                  based on a particular ResourceSpecification.

                      Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                      combination of these) within an enterprise's
                      infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed
                      or used by services (for example a physical port assigned
                      to a service) or contribute to the realization of a
                      Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from
                      the Application, Computing and Network domains, and
                      include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT
                      systems, content and information, and technology
                      components.

                      A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                      representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                      type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification
                      defines the common attributes and relationships of a set
                      of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific
                      instance that is based on a particular
                      ResourceSpecification.

                  Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                  combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or
                  inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services
                  (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or
                  contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM
                  card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and
                  Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements,
                  software, IT systems, content and information, and technology
                  components.

                  A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                  representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                  type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines
                  the common attributes and relationships of a set of related
                  Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is
                  based on a particular ResourceSpecification.

                      Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                      combination of these) within an enterprise's
                      infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed
                      or used by services (for example a physical port assigned
                      to a service) or contribute to the realization of a
                      Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from
                      the Application, Computing and Network domains, and
                      include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT
                      systems, content and information, and technology
                      components.

                      A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                      representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                      type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification
                      defines the common attributes and relationships of a set
                      of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific
                      instance that is based on a particular
                      ResourceSpecification.

                  Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some
                  combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or
                  inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services
                  (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or
                  contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM
                  card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and
                  Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements,
                  software, IT systems, content and information, and technology
                  components.

                  A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for
                  representing a generic means for implementing a particular
                  type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines
                  the common attributes and relationships of a set of related
                  Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is
                  based on a particular ResourceSpecification.
